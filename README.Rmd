__rTPC__ is an R package that helps fit thermal performance curves (TPCs) in R. __rTPC__ contains 24 model formulations previously used to fit TPCs and has helper functions to help set sensible start parameters, upper and lower parameter limits and estimate parameters useful in downstream analyses, such as cardinal temperatures, maximum rate and optimum temperature.

The idea behind **rTPC** is to make fitting thermal performance curves easier, to provide workflows and examples of fitting TPCs without saying which models work best. Which model and which workflow is "best" is going to be down to the question that is being asked. Throughout the vignettes, *Things to consider* sections give ideas of what need to be considered about _before_ the analysis takes place.

When developing **rTPC**, we made a conscious decision not to repeat code and methods that are already optimised and available in the R ecosystem. Consequently, the workflows take advantage of [**nls.multstart**](https://github.com/padpadpadpad/nls.multstart) for fitting non-linear least squares regression and packages from the [**tidyverse**](https://www.tidyverse.org) for data manipulation, fitting multiple models, and visualisation.

**rTPC** and the pipelines outlined in the vignettes are in the process of being written up into a methods paper. In the meantime, please cite as:

Daniel Padfield and Hannah O'Sullivan (2020). rTPC: an R package for helping fit thermal performance curves. R package version 0.1.0.

## Bugs and suggestions

Please report any bugs and suggestions to the [Issues](https://github.com/padpadpadpad/rTPC/issues) or email d.padfield@exeter.ac.uk.

## Installation

__rTPC__ can easily be downloaded from GitHub using the `remotes::install_github()`. The vignettes are all available online, but if you would like to build them locally, add `build_vignettes = TRUE` into your `install_github()` command. However, we do not recommend doing this due to the number of extra R packages utilised in the vignettes.

```{r install, eval = FALSE}
# install package from GitHub
remotes::install_github("padpadpadpad/rTPC")
```

## General pipeline

**rTPC** makes it easy to fit multiple models to multiple thermal performance curves.

**Figure 1. General pipeline for fitting thermal performance curves using rTPC**. First, Collect, check, and manipulate data into long format. Next choose which models from **rTPC** are going to be used. Here, a random assortment of four models were chosen. Then fit the models to data using **nls.multstart** and helper functions from **rTPC**. Models can then be visualised using the **tidyverse** suite of packages and common traits of TPCs can be calculated using **rTPC::calc_params()**. This simple pipeline can easily be scaled up to be used on multiple curves.

## Extensions to the pipeline

**rTPC** can also be easily used to do a number of common tasks needed when fitting TPCs, such as model selection, model averaging, incorporating model weights and bootstrapping of model fits.

**Figure 2. Potential applications for fitting thermal performance curves using rTPC**. The pipeline can be easily extended to do model selection or model averaging by calculating AIC or BIC. If there is information measurement variation (e.g. when fitting TPCs to means and standard deviations), the pipeline can incorporate model weights that can drastically change the value of estimated parameters. After the best model has been selected, bootstrapping approaches can help visualise and calculate model uncertainty.
